Privacy Policy for GratisSpil Discord Bot

_Last updated: September 2025_

1. Information We Collect
GratisSpil does not collect, store, or share personal data outside of Discord.  
The bot only processes the following data to function:
- Discord User IDs (for subscription preferences)
- Discord Guild IDs and Channel IDs (to know where to post free game alerts)

All data is stored locally in a simple file/database on the server that runs the bot.  
No personal messages, emails, or other data are collected.

2. How Data Is Used
The collected IDs are used only to:
- Remember which channel is configured for game alerts
- Remember which users subscribed/unsubscribed to tag notifications

3. Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.  
All data stays within the botâ€™s local storage.

4. Data Retention and Deletion
Data is retained only as long as the bot is active in your server.  
If you remove the bot from your server, related data (subscriptions, channel settings) will be deleted automatically.  
You can also request removal of data by contacting the developer.

5. Contact
